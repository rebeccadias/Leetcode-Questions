"""When using the two-pointer approach to remove duplicates from a sorted array, we typically want to compare the element at p1 - 1 with the current p2 because p1 is pointing to the place where the next unique element should go (hence we should check the previous element p1 - 1).
The if-statement now correctly checks if the current p2-th element is different from the last unique element found (which is at index p1 - 1). If it is, then it assigns the value at p2 to the p1 index, moving p1 forward to the next unique position.
