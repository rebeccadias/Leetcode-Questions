Let's break down the line `key_with_max_value=max(collections_dict,key=lambda k:collections_dict[k] )` into smaller parts to understand how it works:

1. `collections_dict` is a dictionary created by `Counter` where each key is an element from the `nums` list, and the corresponding value is the number of times that element appears in the list.

2. `max` is a built-in Python function that returns the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments.

3. The `key` parameter of the `max` function specifies a single-argument ordering function that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in the iterable. In this case, the iterable is `collections_dict`.

4. `lambda k:collections_dict[k]` is a lambda function that takes an argument `k` (which represents a key in the `collections_dict`) and returns the value associated with that key (which is the count of how many times that key appears in the `nums` list).

When the `max` function is called with the `key` parameter, it iterates over the keys of `collections_dict`. For each key, it uses the lambda function to obtain the corresponding count. The `max` function then returns the key that has the highest count.

Here's a step-by-step of what happens when this line of code is executed:

- The `max` function starts comparing the counts of the elements (the values in `collections_dict`), using the lambda function to look them up.
- It keeps track of the key that has the highest count seen so far.
- Once it has checked all the keys, the key with the highest count is returned.

This returned key is assigned to `key_with_max_value`, and since the problem guarantees that there is a majority element, this key will be the element that occurs more than `n/2` times in the list. 

In essence, this line is finding the most frequent element in the `nums` list by using the counts stored in `collections_dict`.
