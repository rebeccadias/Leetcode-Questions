        If the current number nums[i] is positive, since the array is sorted, there's no need to continue because you won't be able to find three numbers that sum up to zero.


        question:
        Why do we increment BOTH j AND k. Wouldn't this cause us to skip over potential valid triplets because it increments two indices at once? My intuition is that we should only increment EITHER j OR k
        answer:
        
Suppose the current indices (i,j,k) create a triplet. Now you are asking that (i,j+1,k) or (i,j,k-1) could have made a triplet.

But in the first case (j+1) this would give an answer greater than the sum and vice versa for k-1. That means incrementing only one pointer is useless. Itâ€™s better and more efficient to change both pointers after finding a triplet.If you carefully understand the algorithm you will realise that every type of triplet is only being considered once.
